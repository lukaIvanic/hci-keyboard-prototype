# Device Check and Calibration (Template)

## Device check
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
- Ensure the viewport is at least 1024px wide for consistent layout.
- Disable zoom (set to 100%).
- Lock device orientation if using a tablet.

## Optional calibration step
- Ask the participant to tap each corner key once (Q, P, Z, M).
- Confirm the touch target size feels comfortable and no key overlaps occur.
- If taps are difficult, note the device and adjust later in analysis.
