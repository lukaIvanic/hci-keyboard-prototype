# Participant Instructions (Template)

## Overview
You will copy-type short phrases using an on-screen keyboard. Accuracy is more important than speed, but try to type naturally.

## During the session
- Use the on-screen keys only (do not use a physical keyboard).
- If you make a mistake, use the backspace key to correct it.
- Complete the practice trials to get familiar with the layout.
- Continue until the session is finished.

## After the session
- Complete a short NASA-TLX workload questionnaire (about 2-4 minutes).

## Tips
- Focus on accuracy; speed will follow.
- Keep a consistent posture and distance from the screen.

## Questions
If you are unsure about anything, ask the study operator before starting.
