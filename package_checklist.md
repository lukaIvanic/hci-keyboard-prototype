# Project Package Checklist

This checklist mirrors the professor's submission requirements.

Required contents (single ZIP archive):
- Project code (zipped).
- Raw data from experiments (CSV/JSON exports).
- Analysis outputs (spreadsheets or scripts and results).
- Report in English (PDF + source, e.g., DOCX/LaTeX).
- Presentation slides (PPTX/PDF).
- Any demo media (screenshots/video) if live demo is difficult.
- A one-page project memorandum (template included).

Naming suggestions:
- Use clear folder names (code/, data_raw/, analysis/, report/, slides/, media/).
- Include dates in filenames for traceability.
